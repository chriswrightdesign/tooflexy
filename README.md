A simple bookmarklet to toggle Modernizr flexbox/no-flexbox for testing

This is a simple script that is made to work with Modernizr's feature detection of Flexbox. All it does is switch the class .flexbox and .no-flexbox so that you can see what your layout looks like with and without flexbox support.

Feel free to go to my Using flexbox today article and use the bookmarklet to break my layout in the examples.
